# Analyzing_Phoenix

## Through our analysis we are looking for the impact that a “designated analyst role” has on a companies revenue. We feel that there is a direct connection between large and successful businesses and designated analyst roles. We feel that analyst roles are many times and for whatever reason, underrated, undervalued and haphazardly combined with other roles. Through lack of designated focus, siloed management, or unjust hierarchy, the role of the analyst seems to be denied the true power of its proven impact. Our goal is to share evidence that prompts understanding of why creating designated analyst roles is the oldest but newest “BEST PRACTICE”. 

#### 1.) Is having a dedicated analyst role in your company the key to success?
#### 2.) Are companies that have analyst roles more successful than ones that do not?
#### 3.) Is data analysis worth investing in for Small Businesses?
#### 4.) What kind of impact does data analysis have on growing companies?
#### 5.) These are the questions that we seek to gain insight on as we analyze Phoenix...
